🌍 SafeTrip AI
- Smart, culturally-aware travel guidance - powered by AI, built for everyone.

SafeTrip AI helps travelers make safer, more comfortable decisions when exploring unfamiliar cities. From filtering by cultural needs to understanding neighborhood safety, we designed SafeTrip to feel like a local guide and safety companion - all within a simple map-based interface.

🌟 Inspiration
While planning trips abroad, we realized that most travel apps help you navigate places - but few help you understand them. What’s the vibe of this area? Is it safe at night? Does it have halal or vegan options nearby?
SafeTrip AI was born from this need — to empower travelers with real-time, inclusive, and culturally-aware insights.
