   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (copy from `.env.example`):
   ```env
   # Backend API Configuration (Required for full functionality)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HALAL_ROUTES_API=https://api.halalroutes.com

   # Google Maps (Required for map functionality)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your-google-maps-api-key"

## üìö API Setup Guide

### Backend Integration Setup

#### HalalRoutes Backend Connection
1. Clone the HalalRoutes backend repository: `@MelonCaully/halalRoutes`
2. Follow the backend setup instructions in that repository
3. Start the backend server (typically on `http://localhost:8000`)
4. Update your `.env.local` with the correct backend URL:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HALAL_ROUTES_API=https://api.halalroutes.com
   ```

#### Demo Mode vs Full Integration
- **Demo Mode**: Works without backend - uses mock data for demonstration
- **Full Integration**: Requires backend connection for real-time data and AI features
- Toggle via `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_BACKEND_API=true/false` in your environment
